# ðŸ’» Leela Sankar Reddy â€” Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the source code for my personal portfolio website!  
I built this site to showcase my journey as a developer, my skills, projects, certifications, and a little more about me.

This portfolio is not just static â€” it reflects my growth as I evolve as a Computer Science Engineer and a passionate tech enthusiast.  
From Discord bots to full-stack systems, this site tells that story.

## ðŸŽ¯ My Vision

This isnâ€™t just a resume on the web â€”  
It's a living project that evolves with every new skill I learn and every project I complete.

Whether youâ€™re a recruiter, a client, or just a curious visitor â€”  
I hope this gives you an honest glimpse of who I am:  
A student, a problem-solver, and an engineer passionate about design, code, and creative thinking.
